Brain Dump of any kind of ideas that might make a 2d platformer fun. Things that someone might go, "Hey, that was pretty neat!"

I'll start:
- Interesting powers, like in Shovel Knight (Shovel Dive), or that one game where you're holding a broom sweeping stuff
- Interesting power-ups. Mario games are famous for this. Slightly different is Hollow Knight, badges that effect gameplay and powers
- Tight controls
- Good graphics (interesting, unique)
- Good difficulty (Starts out easy but not too easy, increases in difficulty over time)
- Good length (Don't outstay welcome, provide enough to leave a good impression)
-
